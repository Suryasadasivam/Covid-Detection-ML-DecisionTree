# Covid-Detection-ML-DecisionTree
**Overview**

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Covid Prediction" dataset using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to predicting covid, including Breathing Problem,Fever,Dry Cough,Sore throat ,Running Nose,Asthma,Chronic Lung Disease,Headache,Heart Disease,Diabetes,Hyper Tension,Fatigue,Gastrointestinal,Abroad travel,Contact with COVID Patient,Attended Large Gathering,Visited Public Exposed Places,Family working in Public Exposed Places,Wearing Masks,Sanitization from Market, COVID-19  status. Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.
